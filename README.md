# Mini Project 2 - Reactify

Create Application Flow (Simple: landing page, login page, dashboard) <-- Write notes here first! Why are you doing it?
Generate a LoFi Figma
Code it up React Components/Structure (Three pages: landing, sign up/login, and dashboard are minimum)
Stretch Goal 1: HiFi Figma
Stretch Goal 2: Use design framework like Material UI
Stretch Goal 3: Add more pages, flesh out your app more (3 pages minimum)
Stretch Goal 4: Use axios or fetch to get data from third party API (research free apis that are relevant to your app)
Stretch Goal 5: Use BrowserRouting (discussed in late Module 7 slides) to connect pages (landing -> login -> dashboard)
